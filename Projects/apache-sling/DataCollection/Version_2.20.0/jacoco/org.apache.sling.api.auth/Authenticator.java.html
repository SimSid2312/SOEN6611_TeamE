/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Authenticator&lt;/code&gt; interface defines the service interface which
 * may be used by applications to enforce requests to be authenticated (see
 * {@link #login(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)}) or to end enforced
 * authentication (see {@link #logout(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)}
 * ). As such this service may be looked at as the functionality to enable
 * applications to log users in and out.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A very simple login script (using ESP here) could be implemented like this:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * var auth = sling.getService(org.apache.sling.commons.auth.Authenticator);
 * if (auth != null) {
 *     try {
 *         auth.login(request, response);
 *         return; // we are done here
 *     } catch (e) {
 *         // probably NoAuthenticationHandler exception
 *     }
 * }
 * // Authenticator service is missing or no AuthenticationHandler
 * ... do whatever you want to for error handling ...
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Likewise implementing a logout script (ESP, too) is equally simple:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * if (request.authType) {
 *     // not logged in at all, no need to logout
 * } else {
 *     var auth = sling.getService(org.apache.sling.commons.auth.Authenticator);
 *     if (auth != null) {
 *         auth.logout(request, response);
 *     } else {
 *         // handle the case of no Authenticator service to logout with
 *     }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by applications but may be
 * used to initiate the authentication process form a request processing servlet
 * or script.
 *
 * @since 1.0 (Sling API Bundle 2.1.0)
